description: Club Members Who Use the Repeaters

# Description

Many club members are active repeater users.  In fact, supporting the repeater
system and using it without guilt is one of the reasons people join the club.

There is a range of skill levels and technical understanding in the club
members who use the repeaters.  As a baseline, we can assume that they know
how to operate their radios and use basic functions like DTMF dialing, etc.

# Concerns

Club Repeater Users are concerned with how easy it is to use the systems, and 
how reliable they are.  They may also be interested in the range and coverage
area of the repeaters.
