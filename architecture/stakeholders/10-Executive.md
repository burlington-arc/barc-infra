Members of the Executive (President, VP, Committee chairs, etc) are there to
represent the membership and guide the operations of the club.

Collectively, the Executive allocates budgets and verifies that the club's 
investments are made correctly and in the most efficient manner.

Some of the executive members will have deep technical knowledge in the
repeaters.  Some won't, and will want summary information and in particular
to answer "how does this affect the members".
